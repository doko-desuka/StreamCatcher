## StreamCatcher
A browser extension for use with mobile browsers. Download the latest version [in the releases page](https://github.com/doko-desuka/StreamCatcher/releases/latest).

Designed and tested with the Kiwi browser on Android, in **Developer** mode (installed as a ZIP file in the Extensions screen).  
Also compatible with Yandex for Android, loaded as a custom extension (see note at the bottom).

- Besides the extension source code, see this for an example on how to integrate it with your own Kodi add-on: [kodi_example.py](https://github.com/doko-desuka/StreamCatcher/blob/main/Kodi%20Example/kodi_example.py) 
- See this for more details on how the extension and Kodi integration should work together: [Using the mobile browser as a resolver](https://github.com/Gujal00/ResolveURL/issues/279)

Note 1: From the Yandex Android browser customer support:
> You can install add-ons both using the Chrome Web Store and locally. For local installation, go to the browser://extensions page in our browser, then turn on «Developer mode» in the upper right corner, then click «Load unpacked extension» (and select the `manifest.json` file).
> The extensions remain installed until you uninstall the browser or until you manually remove the extensions from the "Add-ons Catalog" menu in the browser.
